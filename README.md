 ### Introduction



### Technologies

- Kanban Board: **Jira**

- Version Control: **Git**

- CI Server: **Jenkins**

- Configuration Management: **Ansible**

- Cloud Server: **AWS EC2**

- Database Server: **AWS RDS**

- Containerisation: **Docker**

- Reverse Proxy: **NGINX**

- Orchestration Tool: **Kubernetes**

- Infrastructure Management: **Terraform**

### Scope

- A **Jira board** with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.

- This could also provide a record of any **issues or risks** that you faced creating your project.

- The application must be deployed using **containerisation** and **orchestration** tools.

- The application must be **tested** through the CI pipeline.

- The project must make use of two **managed Database Servers:** 1 for Testing and 1 for Production.

- If a change is made to the code base, **Webhooks** should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application.

- The infrastructure for the project should be configured using an **infrastructure management** tool (Infrastructure as Code).

- As part of the project, you need to create an **Ansible Playbook** that will provision the environment that your CI Server needs to run.

- The project must make use of a **reverse proxy** to make your application accessible to the user.
